# SOLID principles applied in Typescript

## Single-responsibility principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Open-closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution principle
If S is a declared subtype of T, objects of type S should behave as objects of type T are expected to behave, if they are treated as objects of type T.

## Interface segregation principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.

## Dependency inversion principle
A high-level module should not depend on a low-level module; both should depend on abstraction.
